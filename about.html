<h2>A test conducted by a travel reporter at The Washington Post earlier this year further substantiates these problem areas on planes. The reporter used a germ-detecting swab device on ten touch points on a plane, and nine failed (read: showed alarming quantities of bacteria). The bathroom sink handle had the highest number of germs; the tray table was runner-up.

   Chuck Gerba, a professor of virology in the department of environmental science at the University of Arizona, says his research has shown tray tables and the door latch in the lavatory to be the germiest spots on planes (his studies detected fecal matter on some handles), closely followed by the latches on overhead luggage-storage compartments.
   
   And there’s one more place you should be aware of: drink cans. I typically forgo a plastic cup and drink seltzer water straight from the can to reduce waste, but Gerba told me I might want to rethink that decision (or use an eco-friendly straw). The tops of those cans, along with airline coffee pots, can be festering with bacteria.
   
   Should You Worry About Getting Sick on a Plane?
   Before you go buying a hazmat suit for your next flight, consider that germs found on surfaces in planes are comparable to what you were probably just exposed to in the airport, says William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University. “Any environment where surfaces are constantly being touched by multiple people—be it a hotel lobby, plane, or airport waiting-area seat—is going to have germs,” he says.
   
   However, researchers at Auburn University have found that potentially deadly bacteria, including E.coli and MRSA, are able to live on airplane surfaces like tray tables, seat pockets, and armrests for up to a week.</h2>
